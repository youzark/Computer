Here I provide some paper I think is interesting or easy to read for the final
project purpose. And I will leave a comment for you to choose.

1. gameGenerator: 
 		It's the easiest one to learn about, and it's a really old
	   one. I don't know if professor will accept such a naive paper. And it need
	   some background knowledge on Reinforcement Learning(not too much )
2. concept learner: 
 		A very interesting dissertation, it defines a model that can
	   learn a pattern(like a square , a line or a triangle) , can identify patterns
	   out of complex picture if the pattern is given , it can also "draw" patterns.
	   the paper is not long, but relatively difficult. Need understanding of
	   general neural network model and SDG to quite a degree.(Actually ,I think this
	   this paper can be a really great one, even the one opens a subfield of ML
	   ,I think it's a ubiquitous model).
3. unsupervised image classifier : 
 		I personally think it might be beneficial to read this paper , but it's
		quite complicated.(I haven't finish it yet
