## Ideas 

2021-08-23:
* [X] learn about autoload and ftdetect  #786802d6
* may be develop some tool to generate gantt chart for task warrior
* [ ] try to make use of GTD in taskwiki:  #cf718b6e
	* inbox , instant ,wait ,maybe ,project
	* how to create task with ease (appending all this tags) (sort task with
	  ease)
	* how to group tags
	* how to make use of priority
* [ ] make better version of loginfo ,maybe deploy a database:  #f1e1f4b2
	* more statistic info
	* add project info and tag info
	* record start time and end time(what if no start time just directly done)
	* draw gantt chart
* [ ] how to build knowledge base?:  #27bbe776
	* at least how to link task with file and dir on computer?
	* how to make the link quick and even automated
	* how to link muliple file to a file
	* how to link a particular part of a file to task
	* what if we have muliple task working
	* how to add the link info to knowledge base and automate the process:
		* {knowledge base} {task base} {current working dir}
		* how to pass infomation between the three thing?
	* GREAT IDEA :
		* if we have some way to first relate work space with {a set of tags}
		* and relate knowledge base file to that set of tags
		* every time we start a new task,vim bring us to that dir
		* and get every file change done in vim
		* we can easily track the working file and link them to log and KB
	* A comprimise need to be done: provide some sort of hotkey to jump to
	  corresponding kb page
	* GREAT IDEA:
		* associate projects hierarchy with file hierarchy and thus automatically open corresponding knowledge base file
		* can also set a set of tags link to file hierarchy
		

	
* [ ] learn how to use cmake to make cling work.  #192cb21f


* [ ] learn about cpp library  #df3832cf

* [ ] walk through task warrior thoroughly and think about usage  #64069ddd
