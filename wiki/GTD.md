get things done:

1. maybe I can introduce tags like below:
	1. instant
	2. wanted
	3. project(project will be divide into instant)
	4. due time related
	5. wait
2. in diary ,I should list:
	1. alomst due
	2. |due data - today| < expected time consumption
	3. instant
3. empty your mind and get tasks on paper, don't panic or worry about tomorrow
4. quality and efficiency:
	1. one thing one time( only due with the first(highest priority for whatever reason) instant things )
	2. tomodoro to help to focus
	3. don't feel bad for thing postphoned or cannot be done for you are doing the optimal
5. when to capture new task and subtask? what if we find instant cant be done insantantly?
6. collect tasks and classify them or collect while classify? do I really need a collection box?
7. do I need a check list?

## implement GTD with task warrior
1. treat in box as a tag
2. you can use alias to simplify the routine to add to inbox
3. maybe if it's hard to integrate to task wiki just use keybinddings to sh
   script to get things done
4. Tickle:(useless)
	1. just remind you what to do on a certain day 
	2. like you send a mail to future yourself and you will receive the message
	   the exact day you want to send message to.
	3. just a remainder
5. got to figure out how to get task id of task under cursor for taskwiki
